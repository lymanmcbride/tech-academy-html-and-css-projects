            <p><span style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(24, 24, 24);">God</span> goes, belonging to every riven thing he’s made<br>
                sing his being simply by being<br>
                the thing it is:<br>
                stone and tree and sky,<br>
                man who sees and sings and wonders why<br><br>
                
                <span style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(24, 24, 24);">God</span> goes. Belonging, to every riven thing he’s made,<br>
                means a storm of peace.<br>
                Think of the atoms inside the stone.<br>
                Think of the man who sits alone<br>
                trying to will himself into a stillness where<br><br>

                there is given one shade<br>
                shaped exactly to the thing itself:<br>
                under the tree a darker tree;<br>
                under the man the only man to see<br><br>
                
                <span style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(24, 24, 24);">God</span> goes belonging to every riven thing. He’s made<br>
                the things that bring him near,<br>
                made the mind that makes him go.<br>
                A part of what man knows,<br>
                apart from what man knows,<br><br>
                
                <span style="color: yellow; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgb(24, 24, 24);">God</span> goes belonging to every riven thing he’s made.</p>
